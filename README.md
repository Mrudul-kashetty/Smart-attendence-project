In present academic system, regular class attendance of students plays a significant role in performance assessment and quality monitoring. The common &conventional 
methods used in most of the institutions are by calling names or signing on papers which is highly time-consuming and insecure. The most important strategy to lessen
the proxies is by developing a stricter and moreportable environment.
The system in the current paper is developed by the integration of different components to make a portable application for managingthe student’s attendance. 
The most common methods for attendance maintenance by detection of student’s presence are Face Recognition technology, RFID based system, QR based detection and Real time Attendance using CNN techniques.
So, in this project, we'll look at how we to develop an application to detect and mark the attendance or presence using computer vision which works in hybrid environment. We perform this using Face Recognition
& QR detection-basedtechniques. The modeling will be done with Visual Studio Code, an open source machine learning framework.
